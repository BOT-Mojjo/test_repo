# README PRACTICE #

This repo only exists as a place for me to practice writing readme.md's.
This has been accomplished using new and revolutionary technology such as the 
texteditor "nano" and bash program "git".

## Installlation ##

It's a fancy txt file but sure.
1. First open your git bash terminal of choice
2. run the command `git clone https://github.com/BOT-Mojjo/test_repo.git`
3. Now you have your very own copy of this readme.md file, congratulations!
4. rd -rm test_repo

## License ##
